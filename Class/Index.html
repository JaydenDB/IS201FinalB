            <p>Hercules is arguably the most powerful champion in MCOC due to his sheer versatility and damage output. His abilities revolve around building Feats of Strength, which enhance his attack power and utility over the course of a fight. Hercules shines in extended battles, especially when paired with his immortality mechanic, which allows him to survive with 1 HP for a limited time. This makes him invaluable in difficult content like Abyss of Legends and Labyrinth of Legends, where sustainability and damage are crucial.</p>

            <p>Ghost is a fan-favorite for her unmatched utility and damage potential when played skillfully. She thrives on her ability to phase through attacks, gaining power and damage boosts while phasing.

            <p>Nick Fury brings unparalleled offensive power to the battlefield. Starting as a strong champion, he becomes nearly unstoppable when his Life Model Decoy is destroyed, entering his real Fury phase.
